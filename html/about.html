            <p class="lead">
            Most of the buildings on Fouad Street are characterized by the Greek style mixed with Italian (Florentine) architecture, some of which are still vibrant, while others suffer from the effects of time. Among its most important features is the only opera house in Alexandria, which was built by the French engineer Georges Park and was known for a long time as “Muhammad Ali’s Teatro” and its name was changed to Sayed Darwish Theater in 1962,<br><br><br> in which performances of the most famous Egyptian artists were held. The street is also crowded with many cinemas, perhaps the most famous of which are Plaza and Royal, which were built by the Lebanese Qardahi family, and Amir and Rio Cinema, which live in a distinctive corner of Fouad Street, which was before that a restaurant for beans and falafel for a Turkish named Ragheb.

            Fouad Street is considered a center for literature and the arts in the city of Alexandria. In this street, the Greek poet Cavafy lived. The street also imposed itself in one of the most important novels of world literature, which is the “Alexandria Quartet”, whose chapters were written by the English novelist Lawrence Darrell, where he worked near him, and weaved heroes from his inspiration. The Quartet was Dariley, Bombay, and Clea, the Greek artist who used to live in Fouad Street. As for Justine and Nassim, who are also the heroes of the Quartet, they lived in a house behind Fouad Street. These characters had a realistic origin in reality, and they all met in the "Bstrods" tea room to have breakfast, or to drink a hot drink and talk about the tumultuous life in Alexandria. On this street, one of Tosun Pasha's halls witnessed the first cinema show in Egypt on November 15, 1896.
